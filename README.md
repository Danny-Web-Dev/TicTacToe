# Tic Tac Toe Game with React

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using React. It allows two players to take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid, with the objective of getting three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal.

## Getting Started

To run the Tic Tac Toe game locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/DannyMizrachi/TicTacToe.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```
    cd TicTacToe
    ```

3. Install dependencies using npm or yarn:

    ```
    npm install
    ```

    or

    ```
    yarn install
    ```

4. Start the development server:

    ```
    npm start
    ```

    or

    ```
    yarn start
    ```

5. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to play the game.

## Gameplay

- The game starts with an empty 3x3 grid.
- Players take turns marking spaces with their symbols (X or O).
- The first player to get three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game.
- If all spaces on the grid are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.

## Features

- Built with React, making it easy to understand and extend.
- Implements game logic to determine win conditions and handle player turns.
- Uses CSS for styling and provides a clean and responsive user interface.
